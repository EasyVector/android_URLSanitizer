Don't like those tracking GET queries from the big brothers? Here, this app got your back.
Features:

Cleanup URLs when opening link
Sharing URLs to this app also cleans the URL

How to use:
Opening a link: Simply open the link with this app first, and choose the app you want to use to open the link afterwards.
Sharing a link: Share to this app first, and choose the app you want the link to share to afterwards.
Adding missing GET query(ies): Open the app, fill the query in, then tap on "Add Entry" button.
(Note. Wildcard isn't supported (yet))

How it works:

This app handles Android intent to open/share link, so the app can get the URL and modify it, get rid of those dirty query and create another intent for your original action.
